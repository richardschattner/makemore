# Description
In this repository, I upload some solutions to the exercises of Andrej Karpathys youtube video series about the building of [makemore](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ).

So far, I have implemented a trigram model, using the relative frequencies of trigrams in the names of the training set.
This allows us to sample new characters and generate new names!
